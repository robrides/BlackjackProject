## Blackjack Project
#### Skill Distillery Homework - Week 4

### Overview
* Description
  * This is a Java based console implementation of the Blackjack card game. The objective in developing this application was to focus on object oriented design principles. 
  * To run the project first compile the files then, run BlackjackApp. Follow the console based menus entering the number of choice to navigate through the application.

### Technologies Used
* Java Programming Language
* Java Collections Framework
* Java IO
* Unified Modeling Language
* Eclipse IDE
* Git
* DRY
* Object-Oriented Design

  * Abstraction 
  * Polymorphism
  * Inheritance
  * Encapsulation
  * Interfaces
  * Enumeration
  

### Lessons Learned

* In developing this application, object oriented design was of great focus. Thinking through natural language parts of the game drove logical design decisions. Reusability was also a focus to ensure other card games could be developed based on commonalities such as card which has a suit and has a rank, as well as deck which has a card. Parts unique to the game of Blackjack use the common structures and customize for the specific game. Excellent project to reinforce OO principles.
